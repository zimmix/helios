EV Solar Charge Controller

A software controller that that uses the solar energy generated by a home in excess of consumption, to charge an elecrtic vehicle.  

The current implementation supports the Enphase Solar Gateway and Tesla vehicles.  The system automatically detects when a vehicle is at home, needs a charge and is plugged in.  If multiple vehicles eligible to charge, the system selects the vehicle with the lowest battery level to charge.
